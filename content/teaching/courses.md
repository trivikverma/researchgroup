### [EPA 1316 Introduction to Urban Data Science (Quarter 1 - 2021)]()

Learn how to collect, transform and analyse data using machine learning techniques for understanding urban phenomena.

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

* interpret and discuss data sources that are usable and relatable for a problem presented.

* transform data and consolidate all information into a dataset that is manageable, informative and relates to your problem.

* describe and analyse the consolidated dataset(s) to support your problem with evidence.

* apply models using statistical techniques and machine learning to infer results in the process of turning data into valuable information.

* report results and reflections through visualisation, storytelling and interpretable summaries, especially when faced with a new dataset.

* and hopefully get great data-driven policy jobs in the future, or go on adventurous travels with an open mind.

* but most importantly become mindful of how ML and data can disrupt and impact the lives of multiple communities.
