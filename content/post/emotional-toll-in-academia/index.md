In life as in the sea, I prefer to dive into the deep. I thrive on busy days and weeks where swimming through to-do lists take precedence over meals, friends and family. It comes from a curiosity to understand some of the fundamental paradigms that govern the nature of social processes: urbanisation, movement, segregation, what have you. In academia, that child-like curiosity has become synonymous to competition and on most days I cannot differentiate.

Such rhetoric is not unique to me. Being chiildren of the third world, we grew up in a competitive educational system. Starting at the age of 14, a weekday was eight hours of school, followed by a few more hours of engineering school and finally homework, engineering homework and some more home-work to beat you dead at night. The nonchalance with which I was a straight-A student in engineering school, was of little to no use in a master program at TU Delft. Here, I learned how to work in groups, and on projects that have potential relevance to society. I learned to walk away from the constant stress of being a high-achiever to being an average student doing average things with other average people, yet finding meaning in work that affects the lives of many. That experience meant I could finally forgoe the competitive streak, rest and breathe easy, and focus on the tiny ways in which science can be helpful for our society. Whether it was by design or not, I started breaking away from the cycle of rewqard-repeat.

At an interview for a faculty position, my mentor offered some sagely advice. "Donâ€™t get lost talking about the telescope when you can talk about the stars," he wrote in a last minute email that had me sweating. I am not sure what he meant by that telescope. Perhaps, it was a metaphor for the process of getting to the stars; the methods we use in research and in life. What I understood then was that the methods in research are simply tools to observe the universe around us and essentially do the scientific work that brings our society closer to the truth, which we hope is eventually put to good use. In hindsight, I may have missed an underlying remark in his choice of words. Building a telescope that we use to snake through the academic industry is akin to finding allies.  The latter are emotionally taxing. A faculty position is akin to an enterpreneurship. Public funds make sure you have a comfortable setup to begin with, and then it is all upon you to convince the guardians of other public funds whether you can scale up your ideas into papers and papers into recognition.



But academia does not allow for those ingredients to flourish. Instead, the system pits you against one another, in a battle of never ending public funding where any piece of research is essentially a strategic puzzle to solve. You are left trying to fit your stars to that puzzle, to the ever confounding experience of those who have created it int he first place, and are ever evolving themselves.

The underlying vision for academics is that we are both trusted and expected to do great work. Nobody teaches us how to get there.

If there is one thing I have learned from education, assessment has to align with learning objectives. Have you heard of the the triangle?
