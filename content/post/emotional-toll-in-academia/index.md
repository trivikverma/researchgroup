As a PhD student, I remember reading late into the night. I could see the reflection of my neighbour's television, while I sought perfection on my abstract. I can still feel the joy of riding uphill for 20 min a day to get to work, to see my colleagues. After a long day we would all reconvene in the afternoon for a long coffee chat, before losing ourselves again in our individual scientitifc pursuits. We found each other not only in our quest for knowledge, but also in our shared trauma. The recollection of years I spent in a PhD program are awash in a fog of bitter emotions. At the final interview a professor told me, verbatim, "if it were up to me, I would not hire you." I distinctly remember celebrating the end of a contractual probabtionary clause with the caution of not being lazy. The fear that followed for years to leave the office a minute before twilight was crippling. The discomfort I felt when a certain person walked into the corridor, just to check if my colleagues and I were working... where do I even begin. It would be years before I truly understood the phantom pain from the discrimination on the basis of language and ethnicity. Above all, I can still hear the music of joy and passion I felt for anything in life, fading a day at a time. This is the first time I have written these words but they have marked who I have become ever since.

In 2013, on the twelfth day of January, I boarded the overnight train from Delft to Zurich. It was supposed to be the start of something brilliant but ended up to be the worst years of my life. Whether it was the fight to attend the one conference I would go to in 3 years, or playing ball to a game of ping pong among many politically motivated scholars, or the nature paper I pushed through everyone's doubt, I felt my soul crack under repeated blows. My PhD advisor was a man of carefully chosen words. He reserved them solely for vile critique and judgement, devoid of any constructive feedback and support. Since then, I have forgiven him, moved on, founded a company, left that company, and returned to academia to find more souls cracking every day.

Such rhetoric is not unique to me. As a faculty member I have witnessed countless remarks from PhD students that suggest they are struggling, and continue to struggle everyday, all over the world.

In life as in the sea, I prefer to dive into the deep. I thrive on busy days and weeks where swimming through to-do lists take precedence over meals, friends and family. It comes from a curiosity to understand some of the fundamental paradigms that govern the nature of social processes: urbanisation, movement, segregation, what have you. In academia, that child-like curiosity has become synonymous to competition and on most days I cannot differentiate.

Such rhetoric is not unique to me. Being chiildren of the third world, we grew up in a competitive educational system. Starting at the age of 14, a weekday was eight hours of school, followed by a few more hours of engineering school and finally homework, engineering homework and some more home-work to beat you dead at night. The nonchalance with which I was a straight-A student in engineering school, was of little to no use in a master program at TU Delft. Here, I learned how to work in groups, and on projects that have potential relevance to society. I learned to walk away from the constant stress of being a high-achiever to being an average student doing average things with other average people, yet finding meaning in work that affects the lives of many. That experience meant I could finally forgoe the competitive streak, rest and breathe easy, and focus on the tiny ways in which science can be helpful for our society. Whether it was by design or not, I started breaking away from the cycle of rewqard-repeat.

At an interview for a faculty position, my mentor offered some sagely advice. "Donâ€™t get lost talking about the telescope when you can talk about the stars," he wrote in a last minute email that had me sweating. I am not sure what he meant by that telescope. Perhaps, it was a metaphor for the process of getting to the stars; the methods we use in research and in life. What I understood then was that the methods in research are simply tools to observe the universe around us and essentially do the scientific work that brings our society closer to the truth, which we hope is eventually put to good use. In hindsight, I may have missed an underlying remark in his choice of words. Building a telescope that we use to snake through the academic industry is akin to finding allies.  The latter are emotionally taxing. A faculty position is akin to an enterpreneurship. Public funds make sure you have a comfortable setup to begin with, and then it is all upon you to convince the guardians of other public funds whether you can scale up your ideas into papers and papers into recognition.



But academia does not allow for those ingredients to flourish. Instead, the system pits you against one another, in a battle of never ending public funding where any piece of research is essentially a strategic puzzle to solve. You are left trying to fit your stars to that puzzle, to the ever confounding experience of those who have created it int he first place, and are ever evolving themselves.

The underlying vision for academics is that we are both trusted and expected to do great work. Nobody teaches us how to get there.

If there is one thing I have learned from education, assessment has to align with learning objectives. Have you heard of the the triangle?
