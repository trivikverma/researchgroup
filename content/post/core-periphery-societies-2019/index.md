Every system in our society is inherently core-peripheric. Whether it be politics, elitism, infrastructure, health or science. A group of select few hold the power in the centre and the rest are frayed into a periphery. I wrote an article about the inevitable [emergence of core-peripheries]() in our society a few years ago. Since then I have had a lot to think and discern through other systematic studies of systems that exist in our urban and rural spaces.
