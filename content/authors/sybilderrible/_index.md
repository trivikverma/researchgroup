Sybil Derrible is an Associate Professor in Civil and Materials Engineering and Computer Science, a Research Associate Professor at the Institute for Environmental Science and Policy, and the Director of the Complex and Sustainable Urban Networks (CSUN) Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

His research is at the nexus of urban metabolism, infrastructure planning and design, complexity science, and data science to redefine how cities are planned, designed, and operated for smart, sustainable, and resilient urban systems.

Sybil is the author of the textbook "Urban Engineering for Sustainability" published in MIT Press in 2019 and he received a US National Science Foundation CAREER Award for his work.

He serves as an Associate Editor for the ASCE Journal of Infrastructure Systems. He is also the Chair of the Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS) Section of the International Society for Industrial Ecology (ISIE) and the Vice-Chair of the Critical Transportation Infrastructure Protection committee of the Transportation Research Board (TRB). In fall 2019, he was a Visiting Professor at the University of Transport Technology in Hanoi (Vietnam).
