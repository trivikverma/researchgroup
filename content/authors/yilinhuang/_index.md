I am an Assistant Professor at the section of Systems Engineering and Simulation in the department of Multi-Actor Systems. My research mainly concerns modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) methodology and M&amp;S-based design, with particular interests in data-driven and data analytics related subjects (including data mining and AI), model composability and interoperability, distributed simulation, and design for engagement and sustainability. In the context of data-driven M&amp;S, I am also very interested in information verfication challenges such as assessment of information relevance, accuracy, internal consistency, external corroboration, and reliability of sources. The application domain of my research ranges from transportation and logistics, smart grid, sustainable consumption, to humanitarian innovations.
