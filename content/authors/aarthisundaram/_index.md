For my thesis, I am interested in evaluating the role of social networks in the adoption of energy-efficient technologies for a just energy transition in cities. I use computational social science techniques like Agent-Based Modelling and Network Modelling to understand how the underlying social network topology of a city determines how individuals belonging to different communities make adoption decisions. The result of my work aims to support policymakers in designing effective energy policy interventions that are tailored to their community structures. My broader research goals are in studying how complex socio-economic and technological factors work together to influence how communities adopt clean energy.
