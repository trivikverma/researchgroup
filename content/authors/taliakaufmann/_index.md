I am a trained architect and city planner transformed into a data scientist and visulation expert. More formally, I am a PhD Candidate at [the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/policyschool/) at [Northeasrern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) and visiting the CUSP lab for my final year. Before starting graduate school at MIT, I served as a city planner and a planning information manager at the Tel Aviv-Yafo City Planning Department in Israel.

As part of my research I collaborates with International organizations (as the OECD and European Commission), local and municipal governments (as the government of Israel) to develop data-driven tools for decision-makers in city planning. My goal is to illuminate spatial inequality in access to services and provide policy makers with the tools to improve the quality of life of underserved urban communities. In my research, I ask questions as: how many commercial/recreational/public amenities should be added to a given neighborhood or city and where should those amenities be most needed? And, how far should an urban resident walk/drive/take public transport rides to reach the closest park or supermarket from their home?
