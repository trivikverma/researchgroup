I am a PhD researcher at the Policy Analysis section of TU Delftâ€™s Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management. I am broadly interested in modelling social phenomena using computational/analytical approaches. In my PhD project, I am working on strategies to curb notoriously framed concept of rumour in online social network. More specifically, my research aims to bring more understanding of how the complicated and long-standing phenomenon of rumour can be managed in an effective and timely manner. To this end, multiple approaches like computational, educational, and governance have been taken into account.

From an urban perspective, it is a matter of importance to note that rumours do not emerge in isolation. They need a crowd to burgeon and proliferate, and what can be better than an urban area to satisfy such a need. Urban areas with multiple layers of social networks such as friendship, kinship, and colleagueship combined with similar topics of interest due to the physical proximity, and facilitated by communication technologies are ideal situations for emergence and proliferation of rumours.
