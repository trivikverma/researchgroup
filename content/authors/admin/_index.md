Urban Science & Policy is a research initiative founded at the department of [Multi Actor Systems](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/about-the-faculty/departments/multi-actor-systems/) at the faculty of [Technology, Policy and Management](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/) at TU Delft, the Netherlands and follows the line of research and education promoted by the university on building sustainable and climate resilient cities for the future.

Our research is based on four pillars of DATA, DISCOVERY, DYNAMICS and DEVELOPMENT of urban living spaces such as cities. We work with municipal councils of various cities to collect and analyze large scale social datasets for discovering knowledge about social relationships and use of urban infrastructure. This knowledge establishes the bases for asking the right research questions with respect to a sustainable life in cities for all peoples. Using computational modelling and system dynamics we combine the science of data with modelling and simulation to find vulnerabilities and pathways in decision-making for future development within cities and urban spaces.

Our group focusses on the problems of urban morphology, transportation systems, human mobility, population dynamics, and social values. We employ several methods and techniques from diverse areas such as

* Complex Network Theory
* Dynamical Systems
* Computational Statistics
* Geographical Information Systems
* Machine Learning
* Visualisation
