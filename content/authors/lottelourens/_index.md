With a Bachelor in Technology, Policy and Management, my interests lie in helping out society using data and technology. My research is focused on the accessibility in an urban area using transport systems. I will focus on creating different frameworks which could lead to more equity in these areas.
Besides my academical interest, I enjoy being part of a team which works towards a goal together and being actively involved to see how this goal develops. Therefore, I am also involved in the Engineering and Policy Analysis study association called Dentatus. I enjoy organising the social gatherings that bring people together as well as helping them develop in their career by organising events.
