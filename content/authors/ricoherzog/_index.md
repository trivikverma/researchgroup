With a background in both environmental and industrial engineering, I focus my research on the digitalization of spatial and urban planning. The kind of change the digital revolution brought and continues to bring to everyone's life is unprecedented. It opens up completely new ways to display, perceive and plan urban environments; the exact environment more than 70% of the earth's population will live in by 2050. 
My focus in the CUSP is to research into new means to combine quantitative and qualitative methods to understand and improve citizen participation methods in urban and spatial planning. To put in in the words on Jane Jacobs, "Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are
created by everybody".
