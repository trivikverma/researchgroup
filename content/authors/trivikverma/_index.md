I am an Assistant Professor at the section of Policy Analysis in the department of Multi-Actor Systems. My research aims at modelling the dynamics of urban infrastructure systems and their interaction with humans in an effort to inform policy on sustainable development and planning of cities. I am particularly interested in the design and modelling of resilient, sustainable and public-oriented infrastructure systems.

Through my research, I have discovered that most systems have a tendency to form a core-periphery network that brings an imbalance in the distribution of resources in society. My research and education thus concentrate on understanding and designing urban spaces through the lens of social inclusion.

I also instruct on remote expeditions for [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/expeditions/trip-types/student/) where high school students have the opportunity to learn about conservation, anthropology, engineering and policy. Previously, I helped build a media and technology startup dedicated to the cause of making this planet a healthier place through authentic journalism and data science.
