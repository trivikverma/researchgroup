Previously having lived in Turkey and USA, I recently graduated from my master's study in Complex System Engineering and Management in the Netherlands with my thesis titled "Utilizing volunteering geographic information for the benefit of city planners" where I have collected social media data analysed the data to be used in a Markovian model to understand mobility patterns in the city of Rotterdam.

Currently, I work as a PhD candidate in the project **Designing Rhythms for Social Resiliance** where I co-operate with a team that has professionals from different backgrounds such as urban scientists, architects and artists to explore the concept of rhythm to improve the lives of the citizens by creating various data models and visualizations. Communicating the results is often as important as the analysis itself. Therefore, I am interested in creating data visualizations that communicate information in fascinating ways.
