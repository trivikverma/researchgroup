With a technical undergraduate background in wood science, I have acquired skills in statistical analysis, computer-based mathematical tools, modelling for decision support, and management within the context of advanced manufacturing operations.

Now, as a first-year Masters student of Engineering and Policy Analysis in the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management at Delft University of Technology, I am combining different elements of my technical skill set with my personal interests in social issues.

Currently, I am exploring the relationship between single-mother households and instances of sex crimes in U.S. cities.  In doing so, I hope to gain insight into the roles that strong female figures may have played in forming the attitudes of growing children towards women and their worth in society.
