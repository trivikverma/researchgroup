I am a Masters student in Engineering and Policy Analysis in the Technology, Policy and Management Faculty at TU Delft. I am experienced in building enclosure consulting, and have assisted building owners, architects and contractors design and construct robust building enclosures. Additional experience includes building two- and three-dimensional software models to evaluate the thermal performance of building components to better inform enclosure designs.

My interest in urban science and policy stems from a passion for pursuing architectural efficiency and improving our built environment. While technological solutions have immense problem-solving potential, I believe that effective policy-making is essential in directing this technological progress towards mitigating the environmental, economic and social challenges that we face in todayâ€™s world.
