I am an undergraduate student at Columbia University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in Urban Studies. With that, I have gained computational skills to develop models and simulations of urban phenomena. Currently I am researching street networks to study what are the building blocks of a city and how we can further understand urban issues through this underlying network structure.

With my background in Mathematics, I have been exposed to rather abstract concepts which I would like to bring into the urban planning discussion. I believe that the description of cities through mathematical invariants from Topology or Network Science can help us understand better what are inherent properties of the urban space and what can be improved. I am especially drawn to studying cities of the Global South and the mathematical meaning of urbanism for these cities.

My research interests also include urban modelling and simulation, computational social science, and complexity theory.
