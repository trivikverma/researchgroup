I am a PhD Researcher at the faculty of [Technology, Policy and Management](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/) in [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) within the Department of [Multi-Actor Systems](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/about-the-faculty/departments/multi-actor-systems/). I hold a Bachelor and Masters Degree in Architecture (NMU) and in addition a Masters in Research in Space Syntax: Architecture and Cities (UCL).

Both my practice and research are embedded in system thinking approaches and evidence based methods that draw on data science, urbanism, architecture and sociology. My principle intentions are to firstly understand the logic of the spatial configuration of different urban environments and then empirically test the effectiveness of proposed design and policy interventions within these contexts. I believe that one of the critical sociological functions of the city is to regulate co-presence among people from different social categories and my research interests are centred on understanding how access to social opportunities and services serve to create more inclusive and sustainable cities.

I possess experience working as an architect and BIM specialist for the internationally recognised architectural practices, SAOTA, based in South Africa and AHMM based in the UK. I have directed both architecture and geo-spatial analytical courses at the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey in Mexico. I am also an associate for the UK based think-tank [LGiU](https://lgiu.org), where I write articles on pertinent urban issues in South Africa.
