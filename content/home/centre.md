title: "Centre for Urban Science & Policy"
subtitle: >-
          We are a transdisciplinary research group working to advance urban research, planning and policy in a way that strives for just and equitable outcomes for communities.
          We use a mix of computational spatial science and qualitative participatory methods to investigate how social, economic, environmental and political processes shape cities.
          Our goal is to develop a body of computational approaches and curate evidence that facilitates an integrated systems-based approach for urban planning.
