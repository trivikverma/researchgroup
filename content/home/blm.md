We are a transdisciplinary research group working to advance urban research, planning and policy in a way that strives for just and equitable outcomes for communities. We use a mix of computational spatial science and qualitiative citizen participation methods to investigate how social, economic, environmental and political processes shape cities. Our goal is to develop a body of computational approaches and curate evidence that facilitates a systems-based approach for urban planning.
