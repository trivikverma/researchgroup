Title : Something that talks about the method of the paper for now, and will change into the main result of the paper at the end of the project. E.g. Assessing spatiotemporal resilience of public transit networks
Main section introduction: Start with a the bigger picture, introducing the main problem and narrow down to the knowledge gap. Substantiate your narrative with references. End it with identifying research questions and sub questions. In the main paper later, these will just be replaced with a brief summary of what you do to address the knowledge gap.
Here write 5-7 paragraphs, each talking about three main things
                                                               i.      Every paragraph starts with a topical sentence introducing the main message
                                                             ii.      Body is elaborating on the main message
                                                           iii.      Either a concluding remark or a connection with the next paragraph as the last message
1 main message per paragraph
You can write 5-7 bullet points as you would speak in your elevator pitch, and then expand on each point to make a paragraph out of it.
That already takes care of your literature survey and avoids writing in the format,
Ref a did this
Ref b shows…
Ref c illustrated
Ref d was not up to the mark
And we show this…
If you follow the paragraph-bullet approach you will have a story that can be sharpened later and much, much easier for any other scientist to understand your research.
Next section can be about Data.
Explain the sources, the composition and the properties of the data.
In the proposal you write like you are proposing to do something
When we reformat it later, you already have the material and you can reframe as data description etc. (Always be mindful that some parts will not be in the proposal as they are work after proposing something – you are already far ahead..)
The third section can be Methodology
Describe here how you propose to tackle the problem.
In the paper itself, you will again reformat it to show how you tackle the problem.
Next section can be about timeline showcasing what you will achieve in every week. I think you have ample examples of this from your colleagues and other courses?
Lastly, I’d like to see a rough sketch, even hand drawn with a pen and paper and scanned, to show what kind of results are you expecting to provide for science and policymakers. This is simply a guidance that will change throughout the project, but ideally guide you well.

(I don’t care for things like how will you conduct your research, desk research, process research, things that are meta. For instance, there is no need to write that you will first do a literature survey, then you will collect data then build a model. All this is implicit and a waste of time.)

(It is an hourglass approach / big picture to specific knowledge gap, identifying the very specific method and data in the middle and then elaborating on how we solved everything until we reach the other end of the hourglass and discuss the work we did).
