The course is designed to include two types of assessments:

1. **Formative** : These are `ungraded` and are intended to a) fill gaps in knowledge for those who have not had any programming experience before and b) to serve as a refresher to those who wish to update their skills. The formative components of the course are:

    * [8 In-Class Labs]({{< relref "labs.md" >}}): During the scheduled lab-hours on Wednesday, you can work through the interactive Jupyter Notebooks with TA-s available to help you and answer your questions. I advise you to go through these notebooks before and prepare a set of questions you want to discuss with your TA in class.
    * [8 Peer-Reviewed Homework Questions]({{< relref "labs.md" >}}): A set of homework questions will follow the In-Class Lab sessions to further consolidate your understanding. To enable peer-learning, you have the option to give and receive **Peer-Feedback** for these questions through the [Buddy-check](#buddy_check_url) system on Brightspace. This is neither graded nor obligatory. However, written peer feedback [enhances](https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-016-0017-y) student learning.
    * [Discussion Sessions]({{< relref "discussions.md" >}}): Every Friday you will participate in an online discussion session with your peers to discuss assigned readings. This session will be moderated by a TA in a group of 10-20 students each. The papers that you will read for each week will come along with a set of questions that will guide your reading and subsequent discussions. These papers complement the topic discussed that week in lectures and tested in assignments, therefore you are strongly encouraged to participate. The concepts covered in these sessions will also shape your ideas for the Final Group Project.

2. **Summative** : These are `graded` components and contrinute to the final mark for the course as follows-

    * [Assignment 1](#task_01) (5%)
    * [Assignment 2](#task_02) (10%)
    * [Assignment 3](#task_03) (15%)
    * [Assignment 4](#task_04) (10%)
    * [Final Project](#final_proj) (60%)

### **Assignment 1**

* Type: `Coursework`
* 1h.
* Date: **Thursday, October 24th-2019** (Week 5).
* 20% of the final mark
* Chance to be reassessed
* In-lab electronic submission.

This assessment will consist of an in-lab computer test with multi-option
and short answer questions covering topics introduced in lectures and labs
1-4. More details will be provided during class in advance.

### **Assignment 2** - In-lab computer test II

* Type: `Coursework`
* 1h.
* Date: **Friday, November 21st-2019** (Week 9).
* 25% of the final mark
* Chance to be reassessed
* In-lab electronic submission.

This assessment will consist of an in-lab computer test with multi-option
and short answer questions covering topics introduced in lectures and labs
5-9. More details will be provided during class in advance.

### **Assignment 3** - *Targetting areas*

* Type: `Coursework`
* [Equivalent to 2,500 words] Three maps/tables, code and 750 words.
* 50% of the final mark
* Chance to be reassessed
* Final Assessment
* Due on **Thursday, December 5th-2019** (Week 11).
* Electronic submission only. Static HTML with NO interactive cells.

In this assignment, you will take the role of a real-world data scientist tasked to identify areas to direct investments. You are consulting for the City of Liverpool on a program to target investments towards particularly disadvantaged areas that are nevertheless popular or have the potential to become so. The Economic Development division knows that only five local super output areas (LSOAs) will be funded but would like to know which ones.

Develop a data strategy, deploy it, and present the results in a rigorous but intuitive fashion, together with the code.

**Minimum requirements** (complete *all*)

* Combine *at least two* datasets, potentially among those used in the course.
* Employ *at least two* techniques from the set of analytics covered in the course.
* Justify why you have chosen the methods you use and how they help you answer the question at hand. Critically discuss their limitations too.
* Provide a list of the top five areas that you recommend be funded for improvement.
* Explain clearly how you have arrived at the list and how the decision has been informed by the data analysis and the methodologies employed.
* Include documented code that demonstrate programming understanding of the student.

**Suggestive paths** (optional)

* Combine a LISA analysis of deprivation with kernel density maps of Twitter activity to identify areas of high values at both.
* Combine several relevant variables into a geodemographic analysis to obtain candidate areas and display the results in an aesthetically pleasant choropleth.

**Data**

This assignment can use any of the [datasets]({{site.baseurl}}/datasets.html) employed in the course, and/or any other datasets you consider useful. If you are thinking of including additional datasets, or have ideas in this respect, please get in touch with the module lead ([Dani Arribas-Bel](mailto:D.Arribas-Bel@liverpool.ac.uk)).

**IMPORTANT - MSc Students**: MSc students are *required* to use alternative datasets.
