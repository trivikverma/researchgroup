[^1]: In-class Labs are interactive Jupyter notebooks for practice. Labs are followed with a set of peer-reviewed homework questions. Homeworks are not graded, but your peers will give you feedback. Feedback is an excellent way to learn from other people.
[^2]: Graded Assignments are individual activities and are released two weeks prior on Monday. Due at the end of the specified week on Friday at 2330.
[^3]: Grades and feedback released two weeks after on Friday at 2330.
[^4]: Final Project is a group activity
