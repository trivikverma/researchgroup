## Late Assignments
Assignments must be handed in at the end of a Friday in the week an assignment is due. Late
assignments will receive a 10% penalty for each day or part thereof that they are delayed. This
means a grade 90/100 that is 1.5 days late will be reduced to a 70/100. Assignments more than
10 days late will not be accepted and you will receive a zero for that assignment. If you do turn
in a late assignment, you must turn it in via **Brightspace** so that we know exactly when it was turned
in and can calculate the point reduction. It is your responsibility to understand this policy - if
there is anything unclear, ask me!

## Assignment Format
All assignments will be handed in via bCourses. Assignments should include your full name on
each page. In addition, in order to help with grading, I would like you to include word counts at
the end of each writing assignment.

## Email
I normally respond to emails within a day during a course period. If there is a delay of over 72 hours, do send a reminder. It is not your responsibility to remind me but it may be that the email went to spam or did not reach me. Do not expect us to respond to last minute emails before assignments are due. Substantive questions should be saved for office hours with either me or the TAs.

## Academic Honesty
This is a course designed to provoke critical thinking. While I encourage study groups and
working together to understand course material, all written work should be your own. Please do
not use other studentsâ€™ work for your assignments. If you cite an author or use his/her ideas,
please cite properly. Plagiarized assignments will receive a failing mark. More information on what
constitutes as plagiarism is available from the TU Delft Code of Student Conduct:
http://sa.berkeley.edu/student-code-of-conduct. If you have any further questions, please ask.

## Grade Disputes
Students who wish to dispute grades on an assignment must do so in writing. Grade disputes
must be submitted no sooner than 24 hours after receiving your grade, but within two weeks.
Any dispute should outline specifically why you feel there is an error and should not contain
information about what grades you usually get or how long you spent on the assignment. Please
note that grades may be lowered as well as raised after reviewing assignments.

## Electronic Technology Policy
Computers (laptops, phones, tablets etc.) and recording devices are not allowed in class except to
take the 5-minute quiz during section. Please turn these off and put them away before each class.

## Special Needs / Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
We are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students. If you have any
special needs, please notify us as soon as possible so that appropriate accommodations can be
made. If an unexpected personal or medical challenge is interfering with your ability to complete
assignments and/or attend class, it is your responsibility to contact us as early as possible.
