The course is designed to include two types of assessments:

1. **Formative** : These are `ungraded` and are intended to a) fill gaps in knowledge for those who have not had any programming experience before and b) to serve as a refresher to those who wish to update their skills. The formative components of the course are:

    * [8 In-Class Labs]({{< relref "labs.md" >}}): During the scheduled lab-hours on Wednesday, you can work through the interactive Jupyter Notebooks with TA-s available to help you and answer your questions. I advise you to go through these notebooks before and prepare a set of questions you want to discuss with your TA in class.
    * [8 Peer-Reviewed Homework Questions]({{< relref "labs.md" >}}): A set of homework questions will follow the In-Class Lab sessions to further consolidate your understanding. To enable peer-learning, you have the option to give and receive **Peer-Feedback** for these questions through the [Buddy-check](#buddy_check_url) system on Brightspace. This is neither graded nor obligatory. However, written peer feedback [enhances](https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-016-0017-y) student learning.
    * [Discussion Sessions]({{< relref "discussions.md" >}}): Every Friday you will participate in an online discussion session with your peers to discuss assigned readings. This session will be moderated by a TA in a group of 10-20 students each. The papers that you will read for each week will come along with a set of questions that will guide your reading and subsequent discussions. These papers complement the topic discussed that week in lectures and tested in assignments, therefore you are strongly encouraged to participate. The concepts covered in these sessions will also shape your ideas for the Final Group Project.

2. **Summative** : These are `graded` components and contribute to the final mark for the course as follows:

    * [Assignment 1](#task_01) (5%)
    * [Assignment 2](#task_02) (10%)
    * [Assignment 3](#task_03) (15%)
    * [Assignment 4](#task_04) (10%)
    * [Final Project](#final_proj) (60%)
