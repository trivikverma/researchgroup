[^1]: On Sep 16th 2020, Wednesday, there is no lecture. I think that is because you have an EPA Programme session.

Note: The labs will be updated by at least the previous Friday for every week before it begins.

## Lab 1 - Tools

**IMPORTANT** This is a supplementary notebook that covers many basics of the tools we will use in the course but does not explain anything directly related to Urban Data Science.

Students are encouraged to read it once before getting started with the other notebooks and then keep it as a reference throughout the rest of the course. There are some basic Python operations in there that act as a refresher, practice or learning material.

### Additional materials

If you want to explore further by yourself the contents presented in this tutorial, the following pointers are good places to start:

* [**Video**] ["Python as Super Glue for the Modern Scientific Workflow"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLuIB8aW2KA), keynote speech by Prof. Joshua Bloom from UC Berkley about how Python is used in Astronomy research.
* Gallery of [interesting notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks): a wealth of examples of Jupyter (formerly called IPython) notebooks.
* (Downey, 2012): very good general introduction to Python as a programming language and to the algorithmic way of thinking. The [book](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html) is freely available in [HTML](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html) and [PDF](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf).

### Data

This session uses the **"Census socio-demographics"** dataset of Liverpool, United Kingdom in two parts.

1. Table of LSOA areas in Liverpool with population counts by World region. The table is derived from the CDRC Census data pack. The dataset for this lab is provided in the zipped lab files above.
2. Collection of socio-demographic characteristics from the 2011 Census for the city of Liverpool. A detailed description of the dataset, as well as instructions on how to download it are available on the source link below.

**Source**: [CDRC](https://cdrc.ac.uk/)'s Census data pack for the city of Liverpool (UK). Available in this
[link](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/cdrc-2011-census-data-packs-for-local-authority-district-liverpool-e08000012).

**Instructions**: you will need to be registered on the CDRC website, which is free and very easy. Once logged in, click on the link provided above and select "Download" on the dataset's page.

### Additional materials

* A good extension of this session is (Wickham, 2014). The paper is published under an Open Access license, so it is freely available on the journal's site, but the author has also made available a public [repository](https://github.com/hadley/tidy-data) with the data and code used in the paper. Keep in mind the paper, and the code that comes with it is based on R, not on Python.
* **[Visualization]** Python library `seaborn` [tutorial](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial.html).
* **[Recommended]** (McKinney, 2012): An excellent introduction to Python for data analysis, with plenty of examples and code snippets (Publisher's page [link](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)).
* [NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html?_r=0) about the importance of cleaning data.

Additionally, you will need the raster file for the basemap of Liverpool. This has been assembled by [Dani Arribas-Bel](http://darribas.org) from the [OS VectorMap District (Backdrop Raster)](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/vectormap-district.html), and it is licensed as OpenData. The file is available for download on the following link:
