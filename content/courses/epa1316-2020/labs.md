## Lab 1 - Tools

**IMPORTANT** This is a supplementary notebook that covers many basics of the tools we will use in the course but does not explain anything directly related to Urban Data Science.

Students are encouraged to read it once before getting started with the other notebooks and then keep it as a reference throughout the rest of the course. There are some basic Python operations in there that act as a refresher, practice or learning material.

### Additional materials

If you want to explore further by yourself the contents presented in this tutorial, the following pointers are good places to start:

* [**Video**] ["Python as Super Glue for the Modern Scientific Workflow"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLuIB8aW2KA), keynote speech by Prof. Joshua Bloom from UC Berkley about how Python is used in Astronomy research.
* Gallery of [interesting notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks): a wealth of examples of Jupyter (formerly called IPython) notebooks.
* (Downey, 2012): very good general introduction to Python as a programming language and to the algorithmic way of thinking.

### Data

This session uses the **"Census socio-demographics"** dataset of Liverpool, United Kingdom in two parts. The dataset for this lab is provided in the zipped lab files above.

1. Table of LSOA areas in Liverpool with population counts by World region. The table is derived from the CDRC Census data pack.
2. Collection of socio-demographic characteristics from the 2011 Census for the city of Liverpool.

### Additional materials

* A good extension of this session is (Wickham, 2014). The paper is published under an Open Access license, so it is freely available on the journal's site, but the author has also made available a public [repository](https://github.com/hadley/tidy-data) with the data and code used in the paper. Keep in mind the paper, and the code that comes with it is based on R, not on Python.
* **[Visualization]** Python library `seaborn` [tutorial](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial.html).
* **[Recommended]** (McKinney, 2012): An excellent introduction to Python for data analysis, with plenty of examples and code snippets (Publisher's page [link](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)).
* [NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html?_r=0) about the importance of cleaning data.

### Data

This session uses two datasets which are provided in the zipped lab files above.

1. A dataset about wines from different countries, download from *Kaggle*.
2. A dataset scraped and collected from **Goodreads**.

## Lab 4 - Geo-Visualisation

Lab 4 homework exercises are embedded within the lab files itself. You have to complete the exercises as you go along understanding the rest of the code. There are two files for this lab, ``geovis`` and ``eda``. Submit one or both together as **one** zip file on _Peer_ when you are done. Since this geocomputational lab is not as straightforward as other python code, a **solution set** will be provided for questions indicated in the lab after submission ends.

### Solutions

- lab-solutions-zip

### Data

This session uses multiple datasets which are provided in the zipped lab files above.

1. A **"Census socio-demographics"** dataset as well as the Ordnance Survey **(OS) Geodata Pack**.
2. An **"Index of Multiple Deprivation""** dataset as well as the Ordnance Survey **(OS) Geodata Pack**.
3. Additionally, you will need the raster file for the basemap of Liverpool. This has been assembled by [Dani Arribas-Bel](http://darribas.org) from the [OS VectorMap District (Backdrop Raster)](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/vectormap-district.html), and it is licensed as OpenData.
4. Simple datasets on ``heart diseases``, ``titanic`` and a ``mystery`` you can find out for yourself.

### Additional materials

* A good introduction to the `geopandas` project is provided by Kelsey Jordahl, the project's founder in this [set of slides](http://kjordahl.github.io/SciPy-Tutorial-2015/#1) from a 2015 talk and the companion [repository](https://github.com/kjordahl/SciPy-Tutorial-2015).
* An additional great resource is this 4h. [workshop](https://github.com/carsonfarmer/python_geospatial) by Carson Farmer.

### Data

This session uses multiple datasets which are all provided in the zipped lab files above or separately as a _Brexit_ zip file.

1. An **"Index of Multiple Deprivation""** dataset used in previous labs.
2. A **Brexit** dataset.

This is the dataset of the results of the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU, at the local authority level. All the necessary data have been assembled for convenience in a single file that contains geographic information about each local authority in England, Wales and Scotland, as well as the vote attributes. The file is in the modern geospatial format [GeoPackage](http://www.geopackage.org/), which presents several advantages over the more traditional shapefile (chief among them, the need of a single file instead of several). The file is provided below,

- {{% staticref "epa1316-2020/labs/lab-05/brexit.zip" "newtab" %}}brexit-data{{% /staticref %}}

Unzip and add this file to the data folder as well.

The source data used to compile the file linked above include:

- Electoral Commission data on the EU referendum results ([`url`](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/eu-referendum/electorate-and-count-information))
- Local Authority District boundaries ([`url`](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/83f065f7-3b55-4871-97c8-21579adbee1c/local-authority-districts-december-2015-full-extent-boundaries-in-great-britain))
