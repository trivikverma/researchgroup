The course is divided into a set of interactive lectures, labs and discussions. Lectures are meant to provide students with concepts and theories. Labs are for practising programming in Python and will be self-directed. Discussions are an extremely important part of learning, and students usually bring some great insights from old research papers.

[^1]: In-class Labs are interactive Jupyter notebooks for practice. Labs are followed with a set of peer-reviewed homework questions. Homeworks are not graded, but your peers will give you feedback. Feedback is an excellent way to learn from other people.
[^2]: Graded Assignments are individual activities and are released two weeks prior on Monday. Due at the end of the specified week on Friday at 2330.
[^3]: Grades and feedback released two weeks after on Friday at 2330.
[^4]: Final Project is a group activity

## Format

Eight weeks of:

- **Prep. Materials**: videos, podcasts, articles... 1h. approx. (most recommended!)
- **14x 1h. Lecture**: concepts, methods, examples
- **2h. Computer labs**: hands-on, application of concepts, Python
  (highly *employable*)
- **1h. Paper Discussions**: reading a paper and debating a set of questions with your peers in small groups. (extremely important if you are interested in applying concepts to real-world problems). Please read the paper before coming to the discussion session so you can have a more informed and informal debate with your peers.
- **Further readings**: how to go beyond the minimum (very useful for the final project, if we don't read, we cannot write)

## Content

- **Weeks 1-3**: "big picture" lectures + introduction to
    computational tools (learning curve) + lots and lots of data
- **Weeks 4-7**: lots of spatial, network and machine learning concepts + lots of visualisation
- **Weeks 8-10**: wrap up + prepare an awesome final project in groups

- **Lectures and In-class Labs**: [Virtual Classroom on Brightspace](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/ext/rp/279068/lti/framedlaunch/2af9630e-da09-4858-adb7-932c16dde1c2)

- **Groups, Submissions and Feedback**: Brightspace

## Self-directed learning

**Prepare** for the labs

- **I won't** be leading/lecturing at the computer labs. TAs will be present for abundant help and feedback
- **Go over the notebooks** before the lecture and the computer lab
- If the first time you see a notebook is at the lab, you won't be able to follow on. The best thing to do is to prepare a set of questions to ask the TAs.
- **Bring** questions, comments, feedback, (informed) rants to class/labs. The more you bring, the more we all learn.
- **Collaborate** (it's **NOT** a zero-sum win!!!)

## Assessment

The **summative** [assessments]({{< relref "assessment.md" >}}) are `graded` components and contribute to the final mark for the course as follows:

* Assignment 1 (5%)
* Assignment 2 (10%)
* Assignment 3 (15%)
* Assignment 4 (10%)
* Final Project (60%)

## More help!!!

This course is much more about **"learning to learn"** and **problem
solving** rather than acquiring specific programming tricks or stats wizardry

- Learn to **ask** questions (but don't expect
    exact answers all the time!!!)
- **Help** others as much as you can (the best way to learn is to teach)
- **Search** heavily on Google + Stack Overflow
- **Discussion Forum**: students are encouraged to contribute *meaningfully* to the online discussion forum set up for the course on Brightspace. *Meaningful* contributions include both questions and answers that demonstrate the student is committed to make the forum a more useful resource for the rest of the group. This also enables your peers to learn from your questions and help each other. These will be the official channels of communications between you and us and I cannot guarantee answers to other channels like Slack or WhatsApp groups.
