The course is divided into a set of interactive lectures, labs and discussions. Lectures are meant to provide students with concepts and theories. Labs are for practising programming in Python and will be self-directed. Discussions are an extremely important part of learning, and students usually bring some great insights from old research papers.

## Philosophy

- (Lots of) **methods** and techniques
    - General overview
    - Intuition
    - Very little math
    - Lots of ways to continue on your own
- Emphasis on the **application** and **use**
- Close connection to **"real world"** applications

## Format

Eight weeks of:

- **Prep. Materials**: videos, podcasts, articles... 1h. approx. (most recommended!)
- **14x 1h. Lecture**: concepts, methods, examples
- **2h. Computer labs**: hands-on, application of concepts, Python
  (highly *employable*)
- **2h. Paper Discussions**: reading a paper and debating a set of questions with your peers in small groups. (extremely important if you are interested in applying concepts to real-world problems). Please read the paper before coming to the discussion session so you can have a more informed and informal debate with your peers.
- **Further readings**: how to go beyond the minimum (very useful for the final project, if we don't read, we cannot write)

## Content

- **Weeks 1-3**: "big picture" lectures + introduction to
    computational tools (learning curve) + lots and lots of data
- **Weeks 4-7**: lots of spatial, network and machine learning concepts + lots of visualisation
- **Weeks 8-10**: wrap up + prepare an awesome final project in groups

## Logistics - Website

- **Course Material**: This website
- **Announcements**: Brightspace
- **Submissions and Feedback**: Brightspace
- **Groups**: Brightspace
- **Communication Channels**: To be updated

## Why Python

* **General purpose** programming language
* "Sweet spot" between *"proof-of-concept"* and *"production-ready"*
* Industry standard: **GIS** (Esri, QGIS) and **Data Science** (World Bank, OECD, The Atlantic, Gemeente Den Haag...)

## Self-directed learning

**Prepare** for the labs

- **I won't** be leading/lecturing at the computer labs. TAs will be present for abundant help and feedback
- **Go over the notebooks** before the lecture and the computer lab
- If the first time you see a notebook is at the lab, you won't be able to follow on. The best thing to do is to prepare a set of questions to ask the TAs.
- **Bring** questions, comments, feedback, (informed) rants to class/labs. The more you bring, the more we all learn.
- **Collaborate** (it's **NOT** a zero-sum win!!!)

## More help!!!

This course is much more about **"learning to learn"** and **problem
solving** rather than acquiring specific programming tricks or stats wizardry

- Learn to **ask** questions (but don't expect
    exact answers all the time!!!)
- **Help** others as much as you can (the best way to learn is to teach)
- **Search** heavily on Google + Stack Overflow

[^1]: Labs are interactive Jupyter notebooks for practice at home. Labs are followed with a set of homework questions. Homeworks are not graded, but your peers will give you feedback. Feedback is an excellent way to learn from other people.
[^2]: Released two weeks prior on Monday. Due at the end of the specified week on Friday at 2330.
[^3]: Grades and feedback released two weeks after on Friday at 2330.
