Welcome to EPA 1316 taught by Dr Trivik Verma at Delft University of Technology. The course used to be called Data Analytics and Visualisation and has concurrently been named Introduction to _Urban_ Data Science.

The timetable for the course is:

* **Lectures**: *Monday* 12:00pm-1:00pm, `ERB-ERT`
* **Computer Labs**: *Thursdays* 1:00pm-3:00pm, `CTL-6-PCTC`

## Locations

In 2020, the university has decided to host all lectures online so students can have a safe experience while still being able to continue their studies. All lectures, labs, discussions, office hours and questions will be hosted on MS Teams. You will all receive a link for the course where everyone can interact virtually. I obviously want to see you all in person but desperate times require us all to cooperate and I am really thankful that you are all still here.

* `Online`: To be updated

## Course Language

English & Python {{< icon name="python" pack="fab" >}}

## Expected prior knowledge

Students are not required to have prior programming experience. Although it will be beneficial if you have dealt with a functional programming language like R or Python before. If you have never programmed before, you will have to be more active in homework sessions that will bring you up to speed.

_Alignment courses:_ If you are taking EPA 1333, it will help you in developing programming abilities and the homework sessions from this class will allow you to practice your programming skills. If you are not taking EPA 1333, then you will learn how to program by following the homework scripts and running them by yourself. We will provide ample opportunities in class and labs to discuss any issues/questions from the homework. Graduate students from all faculties are welcome to join. Due to limited resources, especially in online formats, the class will be restricted to a certain number of students and students at the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management will be given first preferences. There are similar courses in other faculties that are also more tailored to your repsctive programs, in case this course is full.

For students who have had statistical, math or computer programming courses in their bachelors or elsewhere, this course will add to your skills by providing you with tools to become future policy-makers, consultants, data scientists, and in general, supporters of open science. The course will offer some uncertainty in terms of what is a problem and how it can be solved. If you are willing to embrace it, we will learn about the fundamentals of urban data science and may even discover new ways of designing equitable urban spaces, from neighbourhoods and cities to entire regions.
