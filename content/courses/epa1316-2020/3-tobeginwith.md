{{% alert note %}}
I want to begin by addressing the pandemic. I am not doing okay. I am sure many of you are also dealing with difficult things. If you are going to share your troubles with me, I am not going to judge you or pass on your private information to anybody else. I hope you can extend the same courtesy to me.

### How to be okay?

I would like to lay out some ground rules for the course:

- [x] You do not owe me "productivity" or "efficiency". I just want your attention, so we can all learn something new.
- [x] You do not owe me any information concerning your personal situation or mental or physical health condition.
- [x] Though, you are welcome to talk to me about anything you are going through. Just drop me an email and we will figure it out.
- [x] If you need extra help, or you have to miss class, or your need more time for something, just ask me. I will work with you, I promise.
- [x] There is a very small grade for participation in this class. Please don't confuse that with attendance. Occassionally, I want your time so we can learn something new together.
