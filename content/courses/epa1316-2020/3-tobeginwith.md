### How can we be okay?

{{% alert warning %}}
Let's address the pandemic. I am not okay and I think none of us are feeling completely okay. If you are going to share your troubles with me, I am not going to judge you or pass on your private information with anybody else. I hope you can extend the same courtesy to me.
{{% /alert %}}

I would like to lay out some ground rules:

- [x] You do not owe me "productivity" or "efficiency". I just want your attention, so we can all learn something new.
- [x] You do not owe me any information concerning your personal situation or mental or physical health condition.
- [x] Though, you are welcome to talk to me about anything you are going through.
- [x] If you need extra help, or you have to miss class, or your need more time for something, just ask me. I will work with you, I promise.
