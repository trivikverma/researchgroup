## Course Language

English & Python {{< icon name="python" pack="fab" >}}

## Why Python

* **General purpose** programming language
* "Sweet spot" between *"proof-of-concept"* and *"production-ready"*
* Industry standard: **GIS** (Esri, QGIS) and **Data Science** (World Bank, OECD, The Atlantic, Gemeente Den Haag...)

## Expected prior knowledge

Students should have some prior programming experience. It will be beneficial if you have dealt with a functional programming language like R or Python before. If you have never programmed before, you will have to be more active in lab sessions which will bring you up to speed.

_Alignment courses:_ As a TPM Bachelor graduate, EPA 1333 Scientific Programming will help you in developing programming abilities, and the homework sessions from this class will allow you to practice your programming skills. As a non-TPM Bachelor student, you do not have to take EPA1333. In this course, you will learn how to program by following the lab/homework scripts and running them by yourself. We will provide ample opportunities in class and labs to discuss any issues/questions from the labs/homework.

_Other faculties/universities:_ Graduate students from all faculties and exchange universities are welcome to join. There are similar courses in other faculties that are also more tailored to your respective programs, in case this course is not what you were expecting it to be. IN that case, please unenroll from Brightspace.

For students who have had statistical, math or computer programming courses in their bachelors or elsewhere, this course will add to your skills by providing you with tools to become future policy-makers, data scientists, and in general, supporters of open science. The course will offer some uncertainty in terms of what is a problem and how it can be solved. If you are willing to embrace it, we will learn about the fundamentals of urban data science. We may even discover new ways of designing equitable urban spaces, from neighbourhoods and cities to entire regions.

## Philosophy of the course

- (Lots of) **methods** and techniques
    - General overview
    - Intuition
    - Very little math
    - Lots of ways to continue on your own
- Emphasis on the **application** and **use**
- Close connection to **"real world"** applications

## Feedback strategy

The students will receive feedback through the following channels:

* **Formative Feedback** weekly general feedback on labs by TAs and direct interaction with the instructor and teaching assistants in the lectures, labs and discussion sessions.
* **Summative Feedback** as graded assessment of three summative assignments and a final project. This will be in the form of reasoning of the mark assigned as well as comments specifying how the mark could be improved. This will be provided before the submission of the next assignment is due so students have the chance to incorporate the feedback in their work.
* **Peer Feedback** Online discussion forum maintained by the instructor where students can contribute by asking and answering questions related to the modules.

## Key texts and learning resources

Access to materials, including lecture slides and lab notebooks, is centralized through the
use of a course website available through the following url:

[`https://cusp.tbm.tudelft.nl/courses/epa1316/`](https://cusp.tbm.tudelft.nl/courses/epa1316/)

Specific readings, videos, and/or podcasts, as well as academic references will be provided for each lecture and lab, and can be accessed through the course website.
