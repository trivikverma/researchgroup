# Workflows

Depending on the type of study that you're doing there are different step-wise approaches or workflows to follow. The first important distinction should be made between a data science and a simulation study.

## Data science workflows

| **â„–** | **CRISP-DM** | **OSEMN** |  **Geron \(2017\)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Business understanding | Gather data | Frame the problem and look at the big picture |
| 2 | Data understanding | Clean data | Get the data |
| 3 | Data preparation | Explore | Explore the data to gain insights |
| 4 | Modeling | Model | Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns with ML algorithms |
| 5 | Evaluation | Interpret | Explore many different models and short-list the best ones |
| 6 | Deployment |  | Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution |
| 7 |  |  | Present your solution |
| 8 |  |  | Launch, monitor, and maintain your system |

## Simulation study workflows

The first question to ask is what simulation paradigm are you following? If you haven't decided yet, take a look at the guides to select between System Dynamics, Discrete-Event Simulation and Agent-Based Modeling \(see, e.g., \[[1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6465109)\]\). With a modeling paradigm different approaches exist. Let's take a closer look at them one by one.
