# Setting up Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code

### IDEs

As you know there are plenty IDEs available for Python and R: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) and others. Take a look at [2019 comparison](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/top-python-ides-for-2019) prepared by DataCamp. From our practical experience, it seems that [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has taken the lead. Why so? Well, first of all, it is free. Second, in August 2019, VS Code obtained a new feature: support Jupyter Notebooks. Third, it has a nice minimalist UI, you won't get lost! There are other nice features, Git extensions, linting, etc. that you can explore [here](https://realpython.com/python-development-visual-studio-code/).
