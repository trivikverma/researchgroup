 abstract = {We constrain the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework with binary pulsar observations of orbital period decay due to gravitational wave emission. This framework proposes to enhance the amplitude and phase of gravitational waveform templates through post-Einsteinian parameters to search for generic deviations from General Relativity in gravitational wave data. Such enhancements interpolate between General Relativity and alternative theory predictions, but their magnitude must be such as to satisfy all current experiments and observations. The data that currently constrains the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework the most is the orbital period decay of binary pulsars. We use such observations to place upper limits on the magnitude of post-Einsteinian parameters, which will be critical when gravitational waves are detected and this framework is implemented.},
